      <h2>Work Project 1</h2>
      <h3>
        At Zensar from August 2016 to September 2018
      </h3>
      <p class="justified">
        I was part of team who was to take the old Struts application to Spring project.
        Thus the strut project with JSP and backend combined together, was split to UI project and backend restful project.
      </p>
      <p class="justified text-indented-1em">
        Backend service was created with spring framework, restful endpoints were created for both legacy and new UI to use them. 
        UI was created using Angular and Ionic Framework for easy port to Web and Mobile.
      </p>
      <p class="justified text-indented-1em">
        I learned over the years understanding Struts code, 
        writing restful web services using Spring Framework, 
        using Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server for relational database,
        Mongodb for unstructured data,
        deploy using IBM uDeploy and uCode to Linux Server,
        Angular and Ionic Framework.
      </p>

      <h2>Work Project 2</h2>
      <h3>At Infosys from November 2018 to November 2020</h3>
      <p class="justified">
        I was working with Banking domain client. 
        I was part of team to create restful web services and SOAP services to query data and present forecast of them.
        All the services were written as modular and reusable <a href="https://camel.apache.org/">Apache Camel &#174;</a> routes.
      </p>
      <p class="justified text-indented-1em">
        The design and documents for the service were created and maintained. Sequence diagrams and flow diagrams were minimum added.
        Develop and unit test using JUnit and Mockito the endpoints.
        Then create and run minimal test suites in SOAP UI for testing phase with testing team.
      </p>
      <p class="justified text-indented-1em">
        I learned over the years about Camel routes, 
        deploy on Openshift, 
        using parameters in Helm charts, 
        SOAP services and SOAP UI test cases for various uses,
        log monitoring and dashboard using Splunk,
        monitoring on Openshift using HawtIO and JMX,
        using, producing and code generation with swagger.
